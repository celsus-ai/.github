## Manifest

The journey begins by embracing the immense potential of artificial intelligence, witnessing a turning point with OpenAI. We believe that this revolutionary change will bring about a staggering transformation in many sectors. Our unwavering belief is that the creative destruction accompanying this evolution will provide a pragmatic approach to industries, leading to profound changes in some.

Throughout the history of technology, from operating systems to search engines, social networks to smartphone applications, and from cloud systems to Bitcoin, we have observed how creatively competitive products, grounded in science, have climbed to the top. This experience underscores the importance of fundamental knowledge; without grasping the fundamentals of a science, we cannot generate creative solutions in that field, and we firmly believe that mastering these foundations makes individuals more productive.

Celsus AI embarks on this journey with a vision. Our goal is to expand the ocean of knowledge with articles and short lecture notes that provide in-depth information on the foundations of artificial intelligence. Simultaneously, we transform theoretical knowledge not just into thought but into action and success, making artificial intelligence-based libraries, tools, and products tangible realities. We know that theory, without being put into practice, is like a dry seed; yet, when put into action, it takes root and bears fruit like a flourishing tree.

Our motto: "Knowledge is power on its own, but it only becomes infinitely valuable when shared." This value is the guiding light of our journey because we understand that this value will form the foundation of a future where each of us not only acquires knowledge but also contributes to its growth by sharing.
